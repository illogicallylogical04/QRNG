# QRNG
A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) is a device that generates random numbers using quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as the randomness of quantum states. Unlike traditional random number generators that rely on deterministic algorithms or physical processes that may have inherent biases, QRNGs provide truly random and unpredictable outcomes.
Quantum mechanics allows for phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, which can be harnessed to produce random outcomes. QRNGs typically exploit these quantum properties to generate random numbers by measuring the state of a quantum system, such as the polarization of photons or the spin of electrons.
Random numbers generated by QRNGs have applications in various fields, including cryptography, simulations, and gaming, where high-quality randomness is essential for security and fairness.
