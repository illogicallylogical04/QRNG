# QRNG
**QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator)**

QRNG is a Python-based application that generates random numbers using quantum computing principles. It utilizes the Qiskit library for quantum computing simulations to generate high-quality random numbers.

### Features

- Generates random numbers using quantum circuits and the principles of quantum mechanics.
- Allows users to specify the maximum value and the number of random numbers required.
- Utilizes the Qiskit library for quantum computing simulations.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for generating random numbers.
